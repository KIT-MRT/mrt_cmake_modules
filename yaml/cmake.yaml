# This file helps mrt_cmake_modules to understand how to use external packages.
# Every package.xml entry here is resolved into a sequence of cmake calls and added to
# MRT_INCLUDE_DIRS, MRT_LIBRARY_DIRS and MRT_LIBRARIES, respectively.
# Every entry has the following format:
# name: The name of the findscript. Will be translated into Find<name>.cmake. Scripts in the cmake folder of this package will be considered as well.
# components (optional): components to be specified in the 'find_package(<name> COMPONENTS <components>)' call in cmake.
# include_dirs (optional): [<list of variables set by findscript containing the packages include dirs>]
# libraries (optional): [<list of variables set by findscript containing the packages libraries>]
# library_dirs (optional): [<list of variables set by findscript containing the packages library dirs>]
# targets (optional): [<list of cmake targets defined by findscript (for newer versions)>]
# warning (optional): Outputs this as a cmake warning whenever this dependency is used (useful for deprecating things)
